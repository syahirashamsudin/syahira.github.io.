<blockquote><font size="4" color="black"><p align="justify"> 12 October 2015, the date that I never forget because it give me a full of memories
with all my buddies. We chose the date to spend our time together before we were taking examination (one paper left) in our last semester.
Everything that have been planned is running well on that day. Then, we start our journey from UiTM Machang to Bukit Kluang, Terengganu by
total in 5 cars. It such a beautiful place, calm and most important is the blue sea + clean. After bbq, swimming (boys only), playing games 
(balloons & balls) and not to forget selfie anywhere, then we decided to spend our time for banana boat rides. Anyway it was my 1st
experience riding the banana boat and maybe its gonna be the last time for me :) </p>


<br><p align="center"><img src="images/bananaboat.jpg"> 
<br><br> Just smiling before the nightmare begins </p>

<br><p align="justify"> I would like to share my experience in banana boat rides. First it was slow ride just making sure we get used to our position on the boat.
So, 7 of us just enjoy to see a nice view of the paradise sea. Everything is really good and pretty cool at the 1st time. However, it just a few minutes
to enjoy the view when suddenly my friend behind was flew off from the boat. I dont know how it can be happened because the boat is still slow. Maybe
she is not stable. ha ha ha

<br><br>When all of us is looking and busy to help in bringing her back to the boat, the driver is turnaround the boat and at that time all of us is splashed into
the sea.I really did not know how to feel at that time because i'm totally did not ready yet and never assume that we gonna be throw like that -_-
Oh swear its not funny. Everything is blue because i still open my eyes even in the sea because i were shocked and cannot think anything during the time.
I also can't breathe and unfortunately, my friend is push my head into the sea because both of us did not know how to swim. However i never blame her to 
do that because she also can't think rasionally like me. That will be the funniest thing in our life but not for that time. When she push my head into the sea,
I'm trying to find my another friend. Sadly, she also can't swim but she is cool and act like nothing happen even I know that she also scared.
She tried to help me and both of us is go to the boat slowly, only that is we can do, while the rest is ready on the boat.

<br><br> After all of us is ready on the boat, then we continuing our journey to circumnavigate the islands. Nevertheless, that is not my day because
my friend are request to be splashed again. This time we get the hint but I still can't accept the reality. I dont like it because I do not enjoy the moment
like they were. We are splashed for a twice. Bad thing again because when I'm arise, the boat is far away from me and i'm alone. All of them is closer with
the boat and what are the closer with me that time is the boat's driver. I'm trying to asking for the help but he just stretched me the barrel of oil and never meant to help me. Its
really annoying me, and all of them is laughing at me on the boat. All of them just give a moral support for me to swim near with the boat. How can I do that,
I can't >_< Since I was embarrassed that everybody looking on me, i'm trying as hard as I can to swim to the boat. Yeahhh, I did it after a lot of effort
I have done. I don't know why they were punish me like that, am I wrong? But what I can said, all of these will be my precious memories with them. </p></font></blockquote>
